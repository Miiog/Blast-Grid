# Blast-Grid

A simple web game bace on javascript, css and html

ROLE:
User tap keyboard to avoid the hero grid to crash the falling red grid.
The more second you insist, the more point you have.
The highest point maker would become a hero and have privilege to leave a message on the index. 
The next time player open the index would see the last hero's message.

All data in local only. all point and hero's name are save in .txt

I use the cookies to transfer the goal between two html. This is just a hack not the best proposal I know. 
I would try to upgrade it when I'm free. If you have any better solution, I will really appreciate it.
